# 11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length `n`. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

***Example 1:***

Input: `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
Output: `49`
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is `49`.

***Example 2:***

Input: `height = [1,1]`
Output: `1`
 

**Constraints:**

`n == height.length`
`2 <= n <= 105`
`0 <= height[i] <= 104`

        while forward < backward:
            area = max(min(height[backward], height[forward]) * (backward-forward), area)
            if height[forward] >= height[backward]: # if the left stick is bigger
                backward -= 1 # the right side cursor decrease
            else:
                forward += 1 # or the opposite
        return area
